# odin-recipes
This is my first website containing recipies on different pages/links.

Once this have been completed I should have a better understanding on how to link to different pages on my own website.
It should also provide me with a better understanding on how to structure files and folders.
It should give me a better understanding for how to structure a website and what commands to use.
 
Have fun!
